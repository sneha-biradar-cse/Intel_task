Intel Internship – DSA Assignment

Implemented Topics
- Binary Search Tree (BST) Insertion
- Red-Black Tree Insertion with Fix-Up
- Inorder Traversal

Language Used
- C

Files
- tree.c : BST and Red-Black Tree insertion with inorder traversal

Output
- Inorder traversal is used to verify correctness.

Notes
- This assignment demonstrates understanding of core DSA concepts such as trees, balancing, rotations, and dynamic memory management.

Output

Binary Search Tree (BST)
Input: 10, 5, 20, 3, 7, 15

Output:
3 5 7 10 15 20

Inorder traversal confirms correct BST insertion.

Red-Black Tree
Input: 10, 5, 20, 3, 7, 15

Output:
3(B) 5(R) 7(B) 10(B) 15(R) 20(B)

Sorted output confirms BST property, and node colors confirm Red-Black Tree balancing.
