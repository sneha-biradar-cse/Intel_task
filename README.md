# Intel Internship – DSA Assignment  
BST and Red-Black Tree Implementation in C

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This assignment implements two fundamental data structures:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **Red-Black Tree (RBT)**

The goal of the assignment is to demonstrate understanding of:
- Tree-based data structures
- Insertion algorithms
- Tree balancing using rotations and recoloring
- Use of inorder traversal to verify correctness

The entire implementation is written **from scratch in C** using structures, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.

## 🧠 Implemented Topics

- Binary Search Tree (BST) Insertion  
- Inorder Traversal of BST  
- Red-Black Tree Insertion  
- Fix-up operations in Red-Black Tree  
  - Recoloring
  - Left Rotation
  - Right Rotation  

---

## 💻 Language Used

- **C**

---

## 📂 Files

- `tree.c`  
  Contains:
  - BST insertion and inorder traversal
  - Red-Black Tree insertion with balancing logic
  - Rotations and violation fixing
  - Main function to test both trees

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run

### Compile
```bash
gcc tree.c -o tree
